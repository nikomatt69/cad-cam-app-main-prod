- Create geometrically valid elements with realistic dimensions, proportions, and spatial relationships
- Use a coherent design approach with {{complexity}} complexity 
- Apply a {{style}} design style
- Ensure all elements include required properties for their type
- Position elements appropriately in 3D space with proper relative positions
- Use consistent units (mm) and scale
- For complex assemblies, use hierarchical organization

Element Types & Required Properties:
- cube: x, y, z (center position), width, height, depth, color (hex)
- sphere: x, y, z (center position), radius, color (hex)
- cylinder: x, y, z (center position), radius, height, color (hex)
- cone: x, y, z (base center position), radius, height, color (hex)
- torus: x, y, z (center position), radius, tubeRadius, color (hex)
